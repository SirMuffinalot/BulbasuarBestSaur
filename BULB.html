				Known as the Seed Pokémon,<br>
				Bulbasaur resembles a small, squating dinosaur that walks on four legs and has a large plant bulb on its back.<br> 
				It also has large red eyes and very sharp teeth. Its skin is a light turquoise color with dark green spots.<br> 
				Its most notable feature, however, is the aforementioned bulb on its back, which as the Pokédex states, was planted on it at birth.<br> 
				Bulbasaurs have "bulbs" on their backs that grow steadily larger as the Bulbasaur matures.<br> 
				This bulb contains a seed which uses photosynthesis to supply Bulbasaur with energy<br> 
				Its bulb is also used to store the energy which the seed absorbs, which can be used when it is necessary.<br> 
				It is assumed that when a Bulbasaur collects enough energy in its bulb, it will evolve into an Ivysaur.<br> 
				As Bulbasaur is a starter Pokémon, it is hard to locate, however, it could be found near streams.<br>
